# Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will look at in detail two simulations
  - **two particle with wall** with concave particles
  - **compressive test** with circular and hexagon shaped particles.
Objective is to provide a very clear picture of setup and also provide some insights about the design of library. 

We will use python helper script [util.py](util.py) to prepare the `input.yaml` (main input file), `.geo` (input file for gmsh), `.csv` (particle locations file). If one understands how to generate input files for the two tests considered here, it is super easy to create input file for any complex setup.
